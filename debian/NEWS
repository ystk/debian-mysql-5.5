mysql-5.5 (5.5.35+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  mysql-server-5.5 ships with the upstream mysql_install_db script which
  creates a database "test" and sets up permissions that allow anonymous
  access, without a password, from localhost to the "test" database and
  any databases starting with "test_" that users might have created
  after installing mysql-server.

  During the migration of mysql-5.1 to mysql-5.5 in Debian the patches
  to drop these permissions and the creation of the test databases were
  not applied. This update resolves this issue for new installations of
  mysql-server-5.5.

  If you are updating from a previous version of mysql-5.5 it is
  recommended to check your installation and to drop these privileges
  and databases manually.

  Further information can be found at the MySQL 5.5 Reference Manual[1].
