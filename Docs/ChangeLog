    Bug #24296076   INNODB REPORTS WARNING WHILE INNODB_UNDO_LOG_TRUNCATE IS ENABLED
    
    PROBLEM
    -------
    
    This warning message is printed when trx_sys->rseg_history_len is greater than some
    arbitrary magic number (2000000). By seeing the reproducing scenario where we keep
    a read view open and do a lot of transactions on table which increases the hitsory
    length it is entirely possible that trx_sys->rseg_history_len can exceed 2000000.
    So this is not a bug due to corruption of history length.The warning message was
    just added to test some scenario and not removed.
    
    FIX
    ---
    
    1.Print this warning message only for debug versions.
    2.Modified the warning message with more detailed information.
    3.Don't crash even in debug versions.

    Bug #26881946: INCORRECT BEHAVIOR WITH "VALUES"
    
    Issue:
    ------
    VALUES doesn't have a type() function and is considered a
    Item_field.
    
    Solution for 5.7:
    -----------------
    Add a new type() function for Item_values_insert.
    
    On 8.0 and trunk it was fixed by Mithun's Bug#19601973.
    
    Solution for 5.6:
    -----------------
    Additionally Bug#17458914 is backported.
    
    This will address the problem of using VALUES() in
    INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE. Create a field object
    only if it is in the UPDATE clause, else return a NULL
    item.
    
    This will also address the problems mentioned in
    Bug#14789787 and Bug#16756402.
    
    Solution for 5.5:
    -----------------
    As mentioned above Bug#17458914 is backported.
    
    Additionally Bug#14786324 is also backported.
    
    When VALUES() is detected outside its meaningful place,
    it should be treated as NULL and is thus replaced with a
    Field_null object, with the same name as the original
    field.
    
    Fields with type NULL are generally not handled well inside
    the server (e.g Innodb will not accept them and it is
    impossible to create them in regular tables). So create a
    new const NULL item instead.

    Bug #26880757: MYISAM_USE_MMAP=1 ON WINDOWS FREQUENTLY DOES
                   NOT UPDATE FILE ON DISK
    
    Description:- When the server variable, "myisam_use_mmap" is
    enabled, MyISAM tables on windows are not updating the file
    on disk even when the server variable "flush" is set to 1.
    This is inturn making the table corrupted when encountering
    a power failure.
    
    Analysis:- When the server variable "myisam_use_mmap" is set,
    files of MyISAM tables will be memory mapped using the OS
    APIs mmap()/munmap()/msync() on Unix and CreateFileMapping()
    /UnmapViewOfFile()/FlushViewOfFile() on Windows. msync() and
    FlushViewOfFile() is responsible for flushing the changes
    made to the in-core copy of a file that was mapped into
    memory using mmap()/CreateFileMapping() back to the
    file system.  FLUSH is determined by the OS unless
    explicitly called using msync()/FlushViewOfFile().
    
    When the server variables "myisam_use_mmap" and "flush" are
    enabled, MyISAM is only flushing the files from file system
    cache to disc using "mysql_file_sync()" and not the memory
    mapped file from memory to FS cache using "my_msync()".
    ["my_msync()" inturn calls  msync() on Unix and
    FlushViewOfFile() on Windows.
    
    Fix:- As part of the fix, if server variable
    "myisam_use_mmap" is enabled along with  "flush",
    "my_msync()" is invoked to flush the data in memory to file
    system cache and followed by "mysql_file_sync()" which will
    flush the data from file system cache to disk.

    information causes a server exit.
    
    FIX:

    A appropriate error is reported when the cumulative index
    information length exceeds the 2 byte range (i.e 65535).

    Bug #26867652: INCORRECT BEHAVIOR WITH PREPARE STATEMENT
                   AND PARAM IN ORDER BY
    
    Issue:
    ------
    This issue can occur when the ORDER BY list refers to a
    column that contains a parameter in the select list.
    
    Solution:
    ---------
    In JOIN::update_depend_map and get_sort_by_table, the
    ORDER BY list's used_tables isn't checked for parameters.
    This can result in incorrect behavior.
    
    This is a partial backport of Roy's

    Bug#26372491 - RCE THROUGH THE MISHANDLE OF BACKSLASH
    
    DESCRIPTION:
    ===========
    The bug is related to incorrect parsing of SQL queries
    when typed in on the CLI. The incorrect parsing can
    result in unexpected results.
    
    ANALYSIS:
    ========
    The scenarios mainly happens for identifier names
    with a typical combination of backslashes and backticks.
    The incorrect parsing can either result in executing
    additional queries or can result in query truncation.
    This can impact mysqldump as well.
    
    FIX:
    ===
    The fix makes sure that such identifier names are
    correctly parsed and a proper query is sent to the
    server for execution.
