    Bug#26372491 - RCE THROUGH THE MISHANDLE OF BACKSLASH
    
    DESCRIPTION:
    ===========
    The bug is related to incorrect parsing of SQL queries
    when typed in on the CLI. The incorrect parsing can
    result in unexpected results.
    
    ANALYSIS:
    ========
    The scenarios mainly happens for identifier names
    with a typical combination of backslashes and backticks.
    The incorrect parsing can either result in executing
    additional queries or can result in query truncation.
    This can impact mysqldump as well.
    
    FIX:
    ===
    The fix makes sure that such identifier names are
    correctly parsed and a proper query is sent to the
    server for execution.

    Bug#26361149  MYSQL SERVER CRASHES AT: COL IN(IFNULL(CONST,
                           COL), NAME_CONST('NAME', NULL))
    
    Backport of Bug#19143243 fix.
    
    NAME_CONST item can return NULL_ITEM type in case of incorrect arguments.
    NULL_ITEM has special processing in Item_func_in function.
    In Item_func_in::fix_length_and_dec an array of possible comparators is
    created. Since NAME_CONST function has NULL_ITEM type, corresponding
    array element is empty. Then NAME_CONST is wrapped to ITEM_CACHE.
    ITEM_CACHE can not return proper type(NULL_ITEM) in Item_func_in::val_int(),
    so the NULL_ITEM is attempted compared with an empty comparator.
    The fix is to disable the caching of Item_name_const item.

    Bug#26482173: TLS CIPHER NEGOTIATION INCORRECTLY MATCHES ON
                  LAST BYTE ONLY (YASSL)
    
    
    Description:- TLS cipher negociation happens incorrectly
    leading to the use of a different
    
    Analysis:- YaSSL based MySQL server will compare only the
    last byte of each cipher sent in the Client Hello message.
    This can cause TLS connections to fail, due to the server
    picking a cipher which the client doesn't actually support.
    
    Fix:- A fix for detecting cipher suites with non leading
    zeros is included as YaSSL only supports cipher suites with
    leading zeros.

    Bug#26390632: CREATE TABLE CAN CAUSE MYSQL TO EXIT.
    
    Analysis
    ========
    CREATE TABLE of InnoDB table with a partition name
    which exceeds the path limit can cause the server
    to exit.
    
    During the preparation of the partition name,
    there was no check to identify whether the complete
    path name for partition exceeds the max supported
    path length, causing the server to exit during
    subsequent processing.
    
    Fix
    ===
    During the preparation of partition name, check and report
    an error if the partition path name exceeds the maximum path
    name limit.
    
    This is a 5.5 patch.

    Bug#24763131 LOCAL-INFILE DEFAULT SHOULD BE DISABLED
    
    Problem & Analysis: Slave's Receiver thread, Applier thread and worker
        threads are created with LOCAL-INFILE option enabled. As the document
        says https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/load-data-local.html,
        there are some issues if a thread enables local infile.
        This flag should be enabled with care. But for the above mentioned
        internal threads, server is enabling it at the time of creation.
    
    Fix: Further analysis on the code shows that none of threads really
        need this flag to be enabled at any time as Slave never executes
        "LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE" after reading it from Relay log.
        Applier thread removes "LOCAL" before start executing the query.

    Bug#26161247: MTR: --NOREORDER IS SEARCHING FOR TEST SCRIPT ONLY IN MAIN SUITE
    
    Issue:
    ------
    Running MTR with the --no-reorder option by specifying test cases on the
    command line, without prefixing the suite name results in an error saying the
    test case was not found in the main suite. This is because MTR looks for the
    test case only in the main suite, and no other suites.
    
    Fix:
    ----
    The fix involves searching for the test in every suite if only the test name
    is specified. This back-ports two bug fixes: Bug#24967869 and Bug#24365783
