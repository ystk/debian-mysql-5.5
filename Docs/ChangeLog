    Bug #22123583: MYSQL 5.5: MAIN.SP HAS VALGRIND ISSUES
    
    Issue:
    -----
    When a varchar column is used to fill the record in an
    internal temporary table, the length of the string stored
    in the column is not taken into account. Instead the
    default length of packed data is used to copy with memmove.
    This will cause valgrind issues since some bytes are
    uninitialized.
    
    SOLUTION:
    ---------
    The solution is to take into account the length of the
    string stored in the column while filling the record.
    
    This fix is a backport of BUG#13389854.

    Bug #22023218: MYSQL 5.5: MAIN.FULLTEXT HAS VALGRIND ISSUES.
    
    
    Issue
    -----
    This problem occurs when varchar columns are used in a
    internal temporary table. The type of the field is set
    incorrectly to the generic FIELD_NORMAL type. This in turn
    results in an inaccurate calculation of the record length.
    Valgrind issues will occur since initialization has not
    happend for some bytes.
    
    Fix
    ----
    While creating the temporary table, the type of the field
    needs to be to set FIELD_VARCHAR. This will allow myisam
    to calculate the record length accurately.
    
    This fix is a backport of BUG#13350136.

    Bug#20755389 SERVER CRASHES IN ITEM_FUNC_GROUP_CONCAT::FIX_FIELDS ON
                   2ND EXECUTION OF PS
    
    Description:
    ------------
    When MySQL calls 'EXECUTE stmt' firstly to deal with ORDER BY clause which is
    similar with 'ORDER BY 1,(t2a.f2+1)' in find_order_in_list(), it believes the
    first expression is a position, the function replaces the pointer of the first
    expression with Item_field object associated with a temporary table field,
    then releases it after the end of the execution, that behavior destroys the
    pointer of first expression.
    
    After that, when MySQL calls 'EXECUTE stmt' once more, the first expression
    points to an invalid pointer, so it crashed.
    
    Fix:
    ----
    If an item of ORDER clause is a location, reset 'args' with a original value.

    DESCRIPTION
    ===========
    When doing an upgrade, you execute mysql_upgrade. If
    mysql_upgrade fails to connect or it connects with a user
    without the proper privileges, it will return the error:
    
        FATAL ERROR: Upgrade failed
    
    which is not very informative.
    
    ANALYSIS
    ========
    
    In main() and check_version_match(), the condition for
    errors are clubbed together and throw the same error msg.
    The functions need to be splitted up and the corresponding
    error msgs have to be displayed.
    
    FIX
    ===
    Splitted the functions and added the specific error msg.

    Bug #20447262: REPEATED EXECUTION OF PREPARED STATEMENTS FAILS, IF DEFAULT DATABASE IS CHANGED.
    
    Issue:
    ======
    While re-preparing the statement in
    Prepared_statement::swap_prepared_statement for swapping
    the database of PS we only swapped the db string but not
    its length. This resulted in mismatch between the actual
    string and its length. In one particular case where db
    of PS was dropped, we have db as null pointer and length
    as non-zero. strdup which used above values resulted in
    invalid memory access.
    
    Solution:
    =========
    In Prepared_statement::swap_prepared_statement also swap
    db_length along with db variable. Also, remove
    DBUG_ASSERT(db_length == copy->db_length) as this have
    no meaning if they are 2 different entities.

    Description:- Executing FLUSH PRIVILEGES and REVOKE/
    GRANT concurrently crashes the server.
    
    Analysis:- Concurrent FLUSH PRIVILEGES and REVOKE/GRANT
    might trigger a small time frame in which REVOKE/GRANT
    fetches the "acl_proxy_user" information as a part of
    "acl_check_proxy_grant_access()". Meanwhile FLUSH PRIVILEGES
    deletes the old acl structures as a part of "acl_reload()".
    After which REVOKE/GRANT tries to access the hostname in
    "wild_case_compare()" which leads to a crash because of the
    invalid memory access.
    
    Fix:- Mutex lock on "acl_cache" is acquired before fetching
    "acl_proxy_user" information in
    "acl_check_proxy_grant_access()".

    Issue:
    ======
    The fulltext predicate is inside a subquery and involves
    an outer reference; it thus cannot be used for FT index look-up,
    but MySQL does not see it, which causes a illegal access.
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Solution is backported from bug#21140088. Outer reference can
    not be used as argument of the MATCH function. Added check for
    outer reference.

    Issue:
    -----
    This problem happens under the following conditions:
    1) A table partitioned with a character column as the key.
    2) The expressions specified in the partition definition
       requires a charset conversion. This can happen when the
       server's default collation is different from the
       expression's collation.
    3) INSERT DELAYED is used to insert data into the table.
    
    SOLUTION:
    ---------
    While creating the delayed_insert object, initialize it
    with the relevant select_lex.

    Bug #19434916: FATAL_SIGNAL IN ADD_KEY_EQUAL_FIELDS() WITH
                   UPDATE VIEW USING OUTER SUBQUERY
    
    Issue:
    -----
    While resolving a column which refers to a table/view in an
    outer query, it's respecitve item object is marked with the
    outer query's select_lex object. But when the column refers
    to a view or if the column is part of a subquery in the
    HAVING clause, an Item_ref object is created. While the
    reference to the outer query is stored by the Item_ref
    object, the same is not stored in it's real_item.
    
    This creates a problem with the IN-TO-EXISTS optmization.
    When there is an index over the column in the inner query,
    it will be considered since the column's real_item object
    will be mistaken for a local field. This will lead to a
    crash.
    
    SOLUTION:
    ---------
    Under the current design, the only way to fix this issue is
    to check the reginfo.join_tab for a NULL value. If yes, the
    query should not be worrying about the key use.
    
    The testcase and comments added as part of the fix for
    Bug#17766653 have been backported.

    Bug#20755615    CREATING INDEX ON A RENAMED COLUMN WITH CASE CRASH .FRM
                    FILE
    
    PROBLEM
    
    In 5.5 when doing doing a rename of a column ,we ignore the case between
    old and new column names while comparing them,so if the change is just
    the case then we don't even mark the field FIELD_IS_RENAMED ,we just update
    the frm file ,but don't recreate the table as is the norm when alter is
    used.This leads to inconsistency in the innodb data dictionary which causes
    index creation to fail.
    
    FIX
    
    According to the documentation any innodb column rename should trigger
    rebuild of the table. Therefore for innodb tables we will do a strcmp()
    between the column names and if there is case change in column name
    we will trigger a rebuild.

    Bug #21467458 - UNINSTALL PLUGIN DAEMON_EXAMPLE CRASHES
                    MYSQLD.
    
    DESCRIPTION
    ===========
    Crash occurs when daemon_example plugin is uninstalled
    immediately after its installed. This can be reproduced
    by installing and uninstalling the plugin repeatedly.
    
    ANALYSIS
    ========
    The daemon_example_plugin_deinit() function of the daemon
    example plugin calls pthread_cancel() but doesn't wait for
    the worker thread to actually complete before deallocating
    the data buffer and closing the file that it writes to.
    This is causing SEGFAULT!
    
    FIX
    ===
    Added a pthread_join() to wait for the thread to complete
    before doing the cleanup work.
    
    Removed a stray 'x' variable from the example code.
    
    NOTE
    ====
    Have made an entry in .opt file as given below:
    --plugin-dir=$DAEMONEXAMPLE_DIR
    
    This is done so that the program takes plugin directory as
    ../<dbg>/plugin/daemon_example/ instead of
    ../lib/plugin/

    Bug #21503595 : --QUERY-ALLOC-BLOCK-SIZE=-1125899906842624 +
                    PID_FILE CHECK LEADS TO OOM SIG 11
    
    Description:- A server started with 'query_alloc_block_size'
    option set to a certain range of negative values on a
    machine without enough memory may lead to OOM.
    
    Analysis:- Server uses 'strtoull()' to convert server
    variable values of type 'GET_UINT', 'GET_ULONG' or 'GET_ULL'
    from string to unsigned long long. According to the man
    page, 'strtoull()' function returns either the result of the
    conversion or, if there was a leading minus sign, the
    negation of the result of the conversion represented as an
    unsigned value, unless the original(nonnegated) value would
    overflow; in the latter case, strtoull() returns ULLONG_MAX
    and sets errno to ERANGE. So 'strtoull()' converts a small
    negative value to a larger postive value. For example string
    '-1125899906842624' will be converted to an unsigned value,
    '18445618173802708992' (ulonglong typecast of
    '-1125899906842624'). So a
    server started with 'query_alloc_block_size' set to
    "-1125899906842624" on a machine without enough memory will
    lead to OOM since server allocates '18445618173802708992'
    bytes(17178820608 GB) for query allocation block.
    
    Fix:- When server is started with any server variable, of
    type "GET_UINT", "GET_ULONG" or "GET_ULL", set to a negative
    value, a warning, "option xxx: value -yyy adjusted to zzz"
    is thrown and the value is adjusted to the lowest possible
    value for that variable. The dynamic server variable which
    is configured through the client exhibit the same behavior
    as fix made for variables configured during the server
    start up.
