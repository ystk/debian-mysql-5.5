    BUG#23499695: MYSQL SERVER NORMAL SHUTDOWN WITH TIME STAMP
                  700101
    
    ANALYSIS:
    =========
    To set the time 'start_time' of query in THD, current time
    is obtained by calling 'gettimeofday()'. On Solaris
    platform, due to some system level issues, time obtained is
    invalid i.e. its either greater than 2038 (max signed value
    to hold microseconds since 1970) or 1970 (0 microseconds
    since 1970). In these cases, validation checks infer that
    the 'start_time' is invalid and mysql server initiates the
    shutdown process. But the reason for shutdown is not logged.
    
    FIX:
    ====
    We are now logging appropriate message when shutdown is
    triggered in the above mentioned scenarios. Now, even if
    the initial validation checks infer that the 'start_time'
    is invalid, server shutdown is not initiated immediately.
    Before initiating the server shutdown, the process of
    setting 'start_time' and validating it is reiterated (for
    max 5 times). If correct time is obtained in these 5
    iterations then server continues to run.

     - Remove use of touch and chmod.

     - Due to limited feature set in /bin/sh on Solaris, /bin/bash will be
       used on this platform.
     - Give error if directory for UNIX socket file is missing.
     - Privileged user should not log to files owned by different user
       (mysqld will log as before).

    Bug #24496214:  MISLEADING ERROR EXECUTING MYSQLADMIN SHUTDOWN AGAINST A SERVER
    RUNNING FIREWALL
    
    mysqladmin shutdown will try to extract the server's pid file before executing
    the actual shutdown command.
    It will do that by executing a SHOW VARIABLES query and processing the result.
    However if that query fails it print a (somewhat confusing) error mesasage
    and will still continue to do the shutdown command.
    If that passes then the mysqladmin user will get an error but the shutdown will
    still be successful.
    This is confusing so the error message text is changed to say that this is a
    non-fatal error and execution continues.
    No test case added since it'd require a selective query failure device that's
    not available in 5.5.

    Bug #24489302 : ZEROFILL CAUSE MEMORY-CORRUPTION AND CRASH
    
    ISSUE: Heap corruption occurs and hence mysql server
           terminates abnormally in String variable destructor
           when ZEROFILL is used for a column.
           Though the abnormal termination is observed in the
           String destructor, heap corruption occurs at earlier
           stage when function Field_num::prepend_zeros() is called.
           This function, prepends zeros to the actual data and
           works on entire field length. Since the allocated memory
           could be less than the field length, heap corruption occurs.
           Later, when String destructor tries to free heap, the server
           terminates abnormally since the heap is corrupt.
    
    
    
    SOLUTION: In Field_num::prepend_zeros() function, if allocated memory
              is less than the field length, re-allocate memory enough to
              hold field length size data.

    Bug #23303485 : HANDLE_FATAL_SIGNAL (SIG=11) IN
                    SUBSELECT_UNION_ENGINE::NO_ROWS
    
    This patch is specific for mysql-5.5
    
    ISSUE: When max_join_size is used and union query
           results in evaluation of tuples greater than
           max_join_size, the join object is not created,
           and is set to NULL.
           However, this join object is further dereferenced
           by union logic to determine if query resulted in
           any number of rows being returned.
           Since, the object is NULL, it results in
           program terminating abnormally.
    
    SOLUTION: Added check to verify if join object is created.
              If join object is created, it will be used to
              determine if query resulted in any number of rows.
              Else, when join object is not created, we return
              'false' indicating that there were no rows for the
              query.

    The problem was that using a very long subpartition name could

    This patch fixes the problem by reporting ER_TOO_LONG_IDENT
    if a name with more than 64 characters are used as partition
    and subpartition name.

    Bug#24388753: PRIVILEGE ESCALATION USING MYSQLD_SAFE
    
    [This is the 5.5/5.6 version of the bugfix].
    
    The problem was that it was possible to write log files ending
    in .ini/.cnf that later could be parsed as an options file.
    This made it possible for users to specify startup options
    without the permissions to do so.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by disallowing general query log
    and slow query log to be written to files ending in .ini and .cnf.

    Bug#24388746: PRIVILEGE ESCALATION AND RACE CONDITION USING CREATE TABLE
    
    During REPAIR TABLE of a MyISAM table, a temporary data file (.TMD)
    is created. When repair finishes, this file is renamed to the original
    .MYD file. The problem was that during this rename, we copied the
    stats from the old file to the new file with chmod/chown. If a user
    managed to replace the temporary file before chmod/chown was executed,
    it was possible to get an arbitrary file with the privileges of the
    mysql user.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by not copying stats from the old
    file to the new file. This is not needed as the new file was
    created with the correct stats. This fix only changes server
    behavior - external utilities such as myisamchk still does
    chmod/chown.
    
    No test case provided since the problem involves synchronization
    with file system operations.

    Bug #23135667: CRASH AFTER DEEPLY NESTED BUILD_EQUAL_ITEMS_FOR_COND
    
    Problem:
    When build_equal_items_for_cond gets called for a big query
    recursively, the specified thread_stack_size exceeds. But
    optimizer does not handle this condition. As a result, server
    exits.
    
    Solution:
    Check if we exceed specified stack size and if yes exit
    gracefully by throwing an error.
