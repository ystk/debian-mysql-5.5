  Bug#17075846 - UNQUOTED FILE NAMES FOR VARIABLE VALUES ARE
  	       ACCEPTED BUT PARSED INCORRECTLY
  
  When we are setting the value in a system variable, 
  We can set it like 
  
  set sys_var="Iden1.Iden2";		//1
  set sys_var='Iden1.Iden2';		//2
  set sys_var=Iden1.Iden2;		//3
  set sys_var=.ident1.ident2; 		//4
  set sys_var=`Iden1.Iden2`;		//5
  
  
  While parsing, for case 1(when ANSI_QUOTES is enable) and 2,
  we will take as string literal(we will make item of type Item_string).
  for case 3 & 4, taken as Item_field, where Iden1 is a table name and
  iden2 is a field name.
  for case 5, again Item_field type, where iden1.iden2 is taken as
  field name.
  
  
  Now in case 1, when we are assigning some value to system variable
  (which can take string or enumerate type data), we are setting only 
  field part.
  This means only iden2 value will be set for system variable. This 
  result in wrong result.
  
  Solution:
  
  (for string type) We need to Document that we are not allowed to set 
  system variable which takes string as identifier, otherwise result 
  in unexpected behaviour.
  
  (for enumerate type)
  if we pass iden1.iden2, we will give an error ER_WRONG_TYPE_FOR_VAR
  (Incorrect argument type to variable).

  Bug#18185930 UPD_NODE_INSERT_BLOB CAUSES BTR_EXTERN_OWNER_FLAG ASSERTION
  
  Problem:
  
  In the clustered index, when an update operation is done the overall
  scenario (after rb#4479) is as follows:
  
  1.  Delete mark the old record that is to be updated.
  2.  The old record disowns the blobs.
  3.  Insert the new record into clustered index.
  4.  For non-updated blobs, new record must own it. Verified by assert.
  5.  For non-updated blobs, in new record marked as inherited.
  
  Scenario involving DB_LOCK_WAIT:
  
  If step 3 times out, then we will skip 1 and 2 and will continue from
  step 3.  This skipping is achieved by the UPD_NODE_INSERT_BLOB state.
  In this case, step 4 is not correct.  Because of step 1, the new
  record need not own the blobs.  Hence the assert failure.
  
  Solution:
  
  The assert in step 4 is removed.  Instead code is added to ensure that
  the record owns the blob.  
  
  Note:
  
  This is a regression caused by rb#4479.

  Bug#14211271 ISSUES WITH SSL ON DEBIAN WHEEZY I386 AND KFREEBSD-I386
  
  Problem:
  It was reported that on Debian and KFreeBSD platforms, i386 architecture 
  machines certain SSL tests are failing. main.ssl_connect  rpl.rpl_heartbeat_ssl
  rpl.rpl_ssl1 rpl.rpl_ssl main.ssl_cipher, main.func_encrypt were the tests that
   were reportedly failing (crashing). The reason for the crashes are said to be
  due to the assembly code of yaSSL.
  
  Solution:
  There was initially a workaround suggested i.e., to enable 
  -DTAOCRYPT_DISABLE_X86ASM flag which would prevent the crash, but at an expense
   of 4X reduction of speed. Since this was unacceptable, the fix was the 
  functions using assembly, now input variables from the function call using 
  extended inline assembly on GCC instead of relying on direct assembly code.

  Bug#14117012 - CHILD PROCESS MYSQL UTILITIES PICKING UP LOCAL

  Utility as "mysql_upgrade" forks "mysql"/"mysqlcheck". Attaching
  "mysql_upgrade" shows following calls after forking "mysql" or
  "mysql_check" when configuration file information is passed as
  first argument to "mysql_upgrade".
  
  strace -f ./mysql_upgrade --defaults-file=../pdb/my.cnf --socket=../pdb/mysql.sock -f

  But when tool forks "mysqlcheck"/"mysql", "--no-defaults" is passed
  as first argument. Before forking, in function "find_tool" of
  "mysql_upgrade", check is made to verify whether tool can be
  executable or not by calling "mysqlcheck --help" and "mysql --help".
  But argument "--no-defaults", "--defaults-file" or
  "defaults-extra-file" is not passed to "mysql" and "mysqlcheck".
  So my.cnf is searched in default paths.
  
  Fix:
  ------
  Modified code to pass "--no-defaults" as first argument to "mysql"
  and "mysqlcheck" while checking tool can be executed or not.

  Bug#16814264: FILTER OUT THE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA RELAY LOG EVENTS FROM RELAY LOG
  
    Performance schema tables are local to a server and they should not
    be allowed to be executed by the slave from the relay log.
    From 5.6.10, P_S events are not written into the binary log.
    But prior to that, from mysql 5.5 onwards, P_S events are written 
    to the binary log by master.
    The following are problematic scenarios:
        
    1. Master 5.5 -> Slave 5.5
       ========================
      A) RBR: Slave crashes
      B) SBR: P_S statements are replicated.
        
    2.Master 5.5 -> Slave 5.6
      ========================
      A) RBR: SQL thd generates error
      B) SBR : P_S statements are replicated
        
    3. 5.5 binlog executed on a server 5.5 using mysqlbinlog|mysql
       =================================================================
       A) RBR: Server crash  (because of BINLOG'... statement)
       B) SBR: P_S statements are executed
        
    4. 5.5 binlog executed on server 5.6 using mysqlbinlog|mysql
       ================================================================
       A) RBR: SQL error (because of BINLOG'... statement)
       B) SBR: P_S statements are executed.
        
        
      The generalized behaviour should be:
      a) Slave SQL thread should certainly ignore P_S events read from
         the relay log.
      b) mysqlbinlog|mysql should replay the binlog succesfully.

  Bug #14668683 ASSERT REC_GET_DELETED_FLAG(REC, PAGE_IS_COMP(PAGE))
  
  Problem:
  
  The function row_upd_changes_ord_field_binary() is used to decide whether to
  use row_upd_clust_rec_by_insert() or row_upd_clust_rec().  The function
  row_upd_changes_ord_field_binary() does not make use of charset information.
  Based on binary comparison it decides that r1 and r2 differ in their ordering
  fields.
  
  In the function row_upd_clust_rec_by_insert(), an update is done by delete +
  insert.  These operations internally make use of cmp_dtuple_rec_with_match()
  to compare records r1 and r2.  This comparison takes place with the use of
  charset information.
  
  This means that it is possible for the deleted record to be reused in the
  subsequent insert.  In the given scenario, the characters 'a' and 'A' are
  considered equal in the my_charset_latin1.  When this happens, the ownership
  information of externally stored blobs are not correctly handled.
  
  Solution:
  
  When an update is done by delete followed by insert, disown the relevant
  externally stored fields during the delete marking itself (within the same
  mtr).  If the insert succeeds, then nothing with respect to blob ownership
  needs to be done.  If the insert fails, then the disown done earlier will be
  removed when the operation is rolled back.

  BUG#18054998 - BACKPORT FIX FOR BUG#11765785 to 5.5
  
  This is a backport of the patch of bug#11765785. Commit message
  by Prabakaran Thirumalai from bug#11765785 is reproduced below:
  Description:
  ------------
  Global Query ID (global_query_id ) is not incremented for PING and 
  statistics command. These two query types are filtered before 
  incrementing the global query id. This causes race condition and 
  results in duplicate query id for different queries originating from 
  different connections.
        
  Analysis:
  ---------
  sqlparse.cc::dispath_command() is the only place in code which sets 
  thd->query_ id to global_query_id and then increments it based on the 
  query type. In all other places it is incremented first and then 
  assigned to thd->query_id.
        
  This is done such that global_query_id is not incremented for PING 
  and statistics commands in dispatch_command() function.
        
  Fix:
  ----
  As per suggestion from Serg, "There is no reason to skip query_id for 
  the PING and STATISTICS command.", removing the check which filters 
  PING and statistics commands.
        
  Instead of using get_query_id() and next_query_id() which can still 
  cause race condition if context switch happens soon after executing 
  get_query_id(), changing the code to use next_query_id() instead of 
  get_query_id() as it is done in other parts of code which deals with 
  global_query_id.
        
  Removed get_query_id() function and forced next_query_id() caller 
  to use the return value by specifying warn_unused_result attribute.

  Bug #17760379 COLLATIONS WITH CONTRACTIONS BUFFER-OVERFLOW THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT
  
  Description: A typo in create_tailoring() causes the "contraction_flags" to be written
  into cs->contractions in the wrong place. This causes two problems:
  (1) Anyone relying on `contraction_flags` to decide "could this character be
  part of a contraction" is 100% broken.
  (2) Anyone relying on `contractions` to determine the weight of a contraction
  is mostly broken
  
  Analysis: When we are preparing the contraction in create_tailoring(), we are corrupting the 
  cs->contractions memory location which is supposed to store the weights(8k) + contraction information(256 bytes). We started storing the contraction information after the 4k location. This is because of logic flaw in the code.
  
  Fix: When we create the contractions, we need to calculate the contraction with (char*) (cs->contractions + 0x40*0x40) from ((char*) cs->contractions) + 0x40*0x40. This makes the "cs->contractions" to move to 8k bytes and stores the contraction information from there. Similarly when we are calculating it for like range queries we need to calculate it from the 8k bytes onwards, this can be done by changing the logic to (const char*) (cs->contractions + 0x40*0x40). And for ucs2 charsets we need to modify the my_cs_can_be_contraction_head() and my_cs_can_be_contraction_tail() to point to 8k+ locations.

  Bug#17081415:>=4GB ROW EVENT CRASHES SERVER WITH WILD MEMCPY
  OF ROW DATA
  
  Problem:
  ========
  Inserting a row larger than 4G when server uses RBR leads
  to crash.
  
  Analysis:
  ========
  Row-based binary logging logs changes in individual table
  rows. During the execution of DML statements in RBR the
  actual row data will be stored within "m_rows_buf" buffer
  and this buffer contents will be written to binary log.
  "m_rows_buf" is prepared within the following function
  "Rows_log_event::do_add_row_data".
  
  When a huge row is specified as in this bug scenario where
  row size is 4294971520 > UINT_MAX (4294967295) then the
  "m_rows_buf" is reallocated to accommodate the row data and
  then the row is copied to the buffer. During this realloc
  call, the length is getting type casted to "uint" which
  results in overflow. Because of the overflow the reallocated
  memory happens to be incorrect than what was requested
  and it results in a crash during copy of rowdata to buffer.
  
  Hence rows of size > 4GB cannot be written to binary log.
  By default the event_length can be stored within 4 bytes
  which in turn restricts an event's size to grow. Hence large
  rows cannot be replicated using row based replication.
  
  Fix:
  ===
  An error is generated if the row size exceeds 4GB value.

      BUG#17066269: AUTO_INC VALUE NOT PROPERLY GENERATED WITH RBR AND
      AUTO_INC COLUMN ONLY ON SLAVE
      
      In RBR, if the slave's table as one additional auto_inc column,
      then, it will insert the value 0 instead of generating the next
      auto_inc number.
      
      We fix this by checking that if an auto_inc extra column exists,
      when compared to column data of the row event, we explicitly set
      it to NULL and flag the engine that a nulled auto_inc column will
      be inserted.

  Bug #17307201 : FAILING ASSERTION: PREBUILT->TRX->CONC_STATE == 1
                  FROM SUBSELECT
  ISSUE         : In function find_all_keys.
                  If selected row do not satisfy condition
                  then we call unlock_row to release the locked
                  row. Suppose if we have subquery in condition
                  and we have an innodb error during its execution.
                  Then we should not call the unlock_row. If the error
                  is because of deadlock, innodb will rollback the
                  transaction. And calling unlock_row without
                  transaction is an invalid case hence an assertion
                  failure.
  SOLUTION      : We call unlock_row only if only there is no
                  error occurred previously.
                  The solution is back ported from 5.6

  Bug#16287752    INNODB_DATA_FILE_PATH MINIMUM SIZE 
                  IN DOCUMENTATION
  Problem 
  -------
  The documentation says that we support 'K' prefix 
  while specifiying size for innodb datafile in the
  server variable for innodb_data_file_path ,but the
  function srv_parse_megabytes() only handles only 
  'M' (megabytes) and 'G' (gigabytes) .
  
  Fix
  ---
  Modify srv_parse_megabytes() to handle Kilobytes. 
  
  Add in documentation that while specifying size 
  in KB it should be mentioned in multiples of 1024
  other wise they will be rounded off to nearest
  MB (megabyte) boundry .(eg if size mentioned
  as 2313KB will be considered as 2 MB ).

  Bug#16715064 MYSQL COMMUNITY UTILITIES CANNOT CONNECT TO MYSQL ENTERPRISE
  WITH SSL ENABLED
  Problem:
  It was reported that MySQL community utilities cannot connect to a MySQL
  Enterprise 5.6.x server with SSL configured. We can reproduce the issue
  when we try to connect an MySQL Enterprise Server with a MySQL Client with
  --ssl-ca parameter enabled.
  We get an ERROR 2026 (HY000): SSL connection error: unknown error number.
  
  Solution:
  The root cause of the problem was determined to be the difference in handling
  of the certificates by OpenSSL(Enterprise) and yaSSL(Community). OpenSSL expects
  a blank certificate to be sent when a parameter (ssl-ca, or ssl-cert or ssl-key)
  has not been specified.On the other hand yaSSL doesn't send any certificate and 
  since OpenSSL does not expect this behaviour it returns an Unknown SSL error.
  The issue was resolved by yaSSL adding capability to send blank certificate when
  any of the parameter is missing.

  BUG#17324415:GETTING MYSQLD --HELP AS ROOT EXITS WITH 1
  
  Analysis
  --------
  
  Running 'MYSQLD --help --verbose' as ROOT user without
  using '--user' option displays the help contents but
  aborts at the end with an exit code '1'.
  
  While starting the server, a validation is performed to
  ensure when the server is started as root user, it should
  be done using '--user' option. Else we abort. In case
  of help, we dump the help contents and abort.
  
  Fix:
  ---
  During the validation, we skip aborting the server incase
  we are using the help option under the condition mentioned
  above.
  
  NOTE: Test case has not been added since it requires using 
        'root' user.
