      Analysis: 
      Debug control list addition (ListAddDel function

      if new element is subset of already existing element,
      then the new element is not added.
      i.e., set @@global.debug = '+d,abcd', is existing in
      the list then you cannot add "a" or "ab" or "abc"
      in the list.

      Bug#16385711: HANDLER, CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS,
                    PROBLEM AFTER MYSQL_HA_FIND
      
      This problem occured if a prepared statement tried to create a table
      for which there already existed a view with the same name while a
      SQL handler was opened.
      
      Before DDL statements are executed, mysql_ha_rm_tables() is called
      to remove any matching tables from the internal list of opened SQL
      handler tables. This match was done on TABLE_LIST::db and 
      TABLE_LIST::table_name. This is problematic for views (which use
      TABLE_LIST::view_db and TABLE_LIST::view_name) and anonymous
      derived tables.
      
      This patch fixes the problem by skipping TABLE_LISTs representing
      anonymous derived tables and using get_db_name()/get_table_name()
      which handles views when looking for SQL handler tables to remove.

  Before this fix, the command

  could report wrong amount of memory allocated,
  when the amount of memory used exceeds 4GB.
  
  The problem is that size computations are not done using size_t,
  so that overflows do occur, truncating the results.
  
  This fix compute memory sizes properly with size_t.
  
  Tested manually.
  
  No test script provided, as the script would need to allocate too much

      Bug #16311231: MISSING DATA ON SUBQUERY WITH WHERE + XOR
      IN IN-CLAUSE USING MYISAM OR MEMORY ENGINE
      
      Backport from 5.6. Original message:
      
      The coincidences caused a data loss:
      * The query has IN subqueries nested twice,
      * the WHERE clause of the inner subquery refers to the
        outer field, and the whole WHERE clause returns FALSE,
      * the inner subquery has a LEFT JOIN that joins a single
        row with a row of NULLs; one of that NULL columns
        represents the select list of the subquery.
      
      Normally, that inner subquery should return empty record set.
      However, in our case:
      * the Item_is_not_null_test item goes constant, since
        its underlying field is NULL (because of LEFT JOIN ... ON 
        FALSE of const table row with a row of nulls);
      * we evaluate Item_is_not_null_test::val_int() as a part
        of fake HAVING expression of the transformed subquery;
      * as far as the underlying field is NULL, we optimize
        out the whole fake HAVING expression as FALSE as well
        as a whole subquery with a zero result:
        Impossible HAVING noticed after reading const tables";
      * thus, the optimizer ignores the presence of the WHERE
        clause (the WHERE expression is FALSE in our case, so
        the subquery should return empty set);
      * however, during the evaluation of the 
        Item_is_not_null_test::val_int() in the optimizer,
        it marked its "owner" with the "was_null" flag -- that
        forced the subquery to return UNKNOWN instead of empty
        set.
      That caused a wrong result.
      
      
      The problem is a regression of the small cleanup in
      the fix for the bug11827369 (the Item_is_not_null_test part)
      that conflicts with optimizations in the fix for the bug11752543.
      Before that regression the Item_is_not_null_test items
      never were constants.
      
      The fix is the rollback of Item_is_not_null_test parts
      of the bug11827369 fix.

  Bug #16305265 	HANG IN RENAME TABLE
  
  This is a deadlock that will also be fixed in the server by
  Bug #11844915 - HANG IN THDVAR MUTEX ACQUISITION.
  So this is a simple alternate method of fixing the same problem,
  but from within InnoDB.
  
  The simple change is to make rename table start a transaction
  before locking dict_sys->mutex since thd_supports_xa() can call
  THDVAR which can lock a mutex, LOCK_global_system_variables, that
  is used in the server by many other activities.  At least one of
  those, sys_var::update(), can call back into InnoDB and try to
  lock dict_sys->mutex while holding LOCK_global_system_variables.
  
  The other bug fix for 11844915 eliminates the use of
  LOCK_global_system_variables for calls to THDVAR.

  Bug #16044655 CRASH: SETTING DEFAULT VALUE FOR SOME VARIABLES
  
  Problem:
  
  When a system variable is being set to the DEFAULT value, the server
  segfaults if there is no 'default' defined for that system variable.
  For example, for the following statements server segfaults.
  
  set session rand_seed1=DEFAULT;
  set session rand_seed2=DEFAULT;
  
  Analysis:
  
  The class sys_var represents one system variable.  The class set_var represents
  one system variable that is to be updated.   The class set_var contains two 
  pieces of information, the system variable to object (set_var::var) member
  and the value to be updated (set_var::value).
  
  When the given value is 'default', the set_var::value will be NULL.
  
  To update a system variable the member set_var::update() will be called, 
  which in turn will call sys_var::update() or sys_var::set_default() depending
  on whether a value has been provided or not.  
  
  If the sys_var::set_default() is called, then the default value is obtained
  either from the session scope or the global scope.  This default value is
  stored in a local temporary set_var object and then passed on to the 
  sys_var::update() call.  A local temporary set_var object is needed because
  sys_var::set_default() does not take set_var as an argument.
  
  In the given scenario, the set_var::update() called sys_var::set_default().
  And this sys_var::set_default() obtains the default value and then calls
  sys_var::update().  To pass this value to sys_var::update() a local set_var
  object is being created.   While creating this local set_var object, its member
  set_var::var was incorrectly left as 0.  
  
  Solution:
  
  Instead of creating a local set_var object, the sys_var::set_default() can take
  the set_var object as an argument just like sys_var::update().

      set port = values(v);
      
      This happens because the values(v) will be parsed as an Item_insert_value by
      the parser.  Both Item_field and Item_insert_value return the type as
      FIELD_ITEM.  But for Item_insert_value the field_name member is NULL.  In
      set_var constructor, when the type of the item is FIELD_ITEM we try to access
      the non-existent field_name. 
      
      The class hierarchy is as follows:
      Item -> Item_ident -> Item_field -> Item_insert_value
      
      The Item_ident::field_name is NULL for Item_insert_value.  
      
      Solution:
      
      In the parsing stage, in the set_var constructor if the item type is
      FIELD_ITEM and if the field_name is non-existent, then it is probably
      the Item_insert_value.  So leave it as it is for later evaluation.

      Bug#11746817:MYSQL_INSTALL_DB CREATES WILDCARD GRANTS WHEN
      HOST HAS '_' IN THE HOSTNAME
      
      Problem:
      =======
      '_' and '%' are treated as a wildcards by the ACL code and
      this is documented in the manual. The problem with
      mysql_install_db is that it does not take this into account
      when creating the initial GRANT tables:
      
      --- cut ---
      REPLACE INTO tmp_user SELECT @current_hostname,'root','','Y',
      'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y',
      'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','','','','',
      0,0,0,0 FROM dual WHERE LOWER( @current_hostname) != 'localhost';
      --- cut ---
      
      If @current_hostname contains any wildcard characters, then 
      a wildcard entry will be defined for the 'root' user, 
      which is a flaw.
      
      Analysis:
      ========
      As per the bug description when we have a hostname with a
      wildcard character in it, it allows clients from several other
      hosts with similar name pattern to connect to the server as root.
      For example, if the hostname is like 'host_.com' then the same
      name is logged in mysql.user table. This allows 'root' users
      from other hosts like 'host1.com', 'host2.com' ... to connect
      to the server as root user.
      
      While creating the intial GRANT tables we do not have a check
      for wildcard characters in hostname.
      
      Fix:
      ===
      As part of fix escape character "\" is added before wildcard
      character to make it a plain character, so that the one and
      only host with the exact name will be able to connect to the
      server.

  Bug #12546953   "SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'DATADIR';" RETURN EMPTY.
  Problem:
  ===========================================================
  If mysqld daemon is started without a --datadir option
  option, and we issue the SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'DATADIR';SQL command
  at the client it returns an empty path. This is because
  mysql_real_data_home_ptr is being reset to NULL by Sys_var_charptr
  constructor call when the datadir is not given either through
  configuration file (no-defaults) or through mysqld parameters.
  
  Solution:
  ===========================================================
  mysql_real_data_home is an array which stores the path of the datadir
  and mysql_real_data_home_ptr is the pointer to it. The pointer is
  being set to NULL at the Sys_datadir, which is of type Sys_var_charptr,
  constructor call. This is because at Sys_datadir call the def_val 
  parameter was being passed with DEFAULT(0) which is now replaced with
  DEFAULT(mysql_real_data_home). The patch has been tested manually as it
  is not possible to start mtr without a default config file.

  Bug#15977988 TEST RPL_ROW_BACKTICK FAILS VALGRIND TEST
  
  Problem:
  =======
  rpl_row_backtick, rpl_mixed_backtick scripts
  are failing with result content mismatch error in 
  mysql-cluster-5.5 code.
  
  Analysis:
  ========
  There are two reasons for the test script failure.
  1) The result file in cluster code was incorrect. When
  replication is started in row or mixed based mode all SQL
  statements will be generating base64 bit encoded value,
  which should not be recorded as part of result file. This
  is required as the base64 bit output will be different for
  different execution options.
  
  2) As part of the test script regular expressions have
  been added to remove the base64 bit encoded output. But
  still the new pattern that was generated on the cluster
  code was not getting removed from these expressions.
  
  Fix:
  ===
  Another regular expression is being added to replace the
  new pattern.

                    PLATFORM= MACOSX10.6 X86_64 MAX
      
      Problem: The test was failing on pb2's mac machine because
               it was not cleaned up properly. The test checks if
               the command 'start slave until' throws a proper
               error when issued with a wrong number/type of
               parameters. After this,the replication stream was
               stopped using the include file 'rpl_end.inc'.
               The errors thrown earlier left the slave in an
               inconsistent state to be closed by the include
               file which was caught by the mac machine.
      
      Fix: Started slave by invoking start_slave.inc to have a
           working slave before calling rpl_reset.inc
      
      Problem: The test file was not in a good shape. It tested
               start slave until relay log file/pos combination 
               wrongly. A couple of commands were executed at 
               master and replicated at slave. Next, the 
               coordinates in terms of relay log file and pos 
               were noted down followed by reset slave and start
               slave until saved relay log file/pos. Reset slave
               deletes  all relay log files and makes the slave 
               forget its replication position. So, using the 
               saved coordiantes after reset slave is wrong.
      
      Fix: Split the test in two parts:
           a) Test for start slave until master log file/pos and
              checking for correct errors in the failure 
              scenarios.
           b) Test for start slave until relay log file/pos.
      
      Problem: The variables auto_increment_increment and 
               auto_increment_offset were set in the the include
               file rpl_init.inc. This was only configured for 
               some connections that are rarely used by test 
               cases, so likely that it will cause confusion. 
               If replication tests want to setup these variables
               they should do so explicitly.
      
      Fix:
           a) Removed code to set the variables
              auto_increment_increment and auto_increment_offset
              in the include file.
           b) Updated tests files using the same.

      In method mysql_binlog_send, right after detecting a EOF in the
      read event loop, and before deciding if we should change to a new
      binlog file there is a execution window where new events can be
      written to the binlog and a rotation can happen. When reaching
      the test, the function will then change to a new binlog file
      ignoring all the events written in this window. This will result
      in events not being replicated.
      
      Only when the binlog is detected as deactivated in the event loop
      of the dump thread, can we really know that no more events
      remain. For this reason, this test is now made under the log lock
      in the beginning of the event loop when reading the events.

  Bug#16056537: MYSQLD CRASHES IN ITEM_FUNC_GET_USER_VAR::FIX_LENGTH_AND_DEC()
  
  The technical problem was that THD::user_var_events_alloc was reset to NULL
  from a valid value when a stored program is executed during the PREPARE statement.
  
  The user visible problem was that the server crashed if user issued a PREPARE
  statement using some combination of stored functions and user variables.
  
  The fix is to restore THD::user_var_events_alloc to the original value.
  This is a minimal fix for 5.5.
  
  More proper patch has been already implemented for 5.6+. It avoids
  evaluation of stored functions for the PREPARE phase.
  
  From the user point of view, this bug is a regression, introduced by the patch for WL2649
  (Number-to-string conversions), revid: bar@mysql.com-20100211041725-ijbox021olab82nv
  However, the code resetting THD::user_var_events_alloc exists even in 5.1.
  The WL just changed the way arguments are converted to strings and the bug became visible.

  Bug#16274455: CAN NOT ACESS PARTITIONED TABLES WHEN
  DOWNGRADED FROM 5.6.11 TO 5.6.10
  
  Problem was new syntax not accepted by previous version.
  
  Fixed by adding version comment of /*!50531 around the
  new syntax.
  
  Like this in the .frm file:
  'PARTITION BY KEY /*!50611 ALGORITHM = 2 */ () PARTITIONS 3'
  and also changing the output from SHOW CREATE TABLE to:
  CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT)
  /*!50100 PARTITION BY KEY */ /*!50611 ALGORITHM = 1 */ /*!50100 ()
  PARTITIONS 3 */
  
  It will always add the ALGORITHM into the .frm for KEY [sub]partitioned
  tables, but for SHOW CREATE TABLE it will only add it in case it is the non
  default ALGORITHM = 1.
  
  Also notice that for 5.5, it will say /*!50531 instead of /*!50611, which
  will make upgrade from 5.5 > 5.5.31 to 5.6 < 5.6.11 fail!
  If one downgrades an fixed version to the same major version (5.5 or 5.6) the
  bug 14521864 will be visible again, but unless the .frm is updated, it will
  work again when upgrading again.
  
  Also fixed so that the .frm does not get updated version
  if a single partition check passes.

      Problem: Sys_vars suite is disabled in mysql-5.1 branch.
      Fix: To enable sys_vars suite in mysql-5.1, add it in
      mysql-test-run.pl file and also sys_vars suite should be
      added to Makefile.am inorder to get that test directory

                   5.1 SERVER
      
      Problem was caused by the COM_CHANGE_USER parsing code. That code ignored
      character set number passed in COM_CHANGE_USER packet. Instead
      character_set_client values was used. User name was not converted at all.
      
      Fixed by using passed character set number to convert both db and user names.
      If COM_CHANGE_USER does not contain character set number then
      character_set_client is used to convert both names.

  Bug#16263506 - INNODB; USE ABORT() ON ALL PLATFORMS INSTEAD OF
                 DEREFERENCING UT_DBG_NULL_PTR
  The abort() call is standard C but InnoDB only uses it in GCC
  environments.  UT_DBG_USE_ABORT is not defined the code crashed
  by dereferencing a null pointer instead of calling abort().
  Other code throughout MySQL including ndb, sql, mysys and other
  places call abort() directly.
  
  This bug also affects innodb.innodb_bug14147491.test which fails
  randomly on windows because of this issue.

  Bug#14711808 MSI INSTALLATION / UPGRADE CAN CORRUPT EXISTING INSTALLATION
  
  Currently MySQL MSI installer on Windows installs MySQL in 
  "per user" mode. It means that if a Windows machine has 
  multiple users, they each can install MySQL independently. 
  However the default path of MySQL is "C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\"
  and when two users install MySQL on same machine, the installation
  by second user just overwrites the MySQL files. This default shared 
  location leads to the issue where if the second user uninstalls MySQL,
  the installation files are removed for the first user as well.
  
  In this fix, we are now making the default installation "per machine".
  It means that when MySQL is installed with defaults options, all
  users can see the shortcuts for MySQL in start menu(since installations 
  is for all users). Also when any user relaunches the installer, it will 
  consider that action uninstallation rather than installation for that user.
  
  There are command line options in installer that can be used to undo the
  "per machine" installation but will not consider that scenario.MySQL 
  is a server product and it does not make a lot of sense to install it
  differently for each user.
